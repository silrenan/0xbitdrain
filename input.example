# IMPORTANT: This is just an EXAMPLE file!
# 
# To use this script, you must create a file named "input.txt" (not input.example)
# Copy this file and rename it to "input.txt", then add your actual URLs
# 
# The script ONLY reads from "input.txt" - it will NOT work with this example file!
# ==================================================================================

# Example input.txt template
# This file shows the correct format for your media URLs

# STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to "input.txt"
# 2. Replace the example URLs below with your actual media URLs
